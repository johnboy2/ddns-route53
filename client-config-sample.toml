## These affect how the public IP address is determined.
##   - "default_public_ip" means that IP addresses on the system are checked
##     for any that are globally routable. If any are found, they are used and
##     searching stops.
##   - "internet_gateway_protocol" performs a local network search for a router
##     or other Internet gateway device with a WAN IP address that is globally
##     routable. If any are found, they are used and searching stops.
##     Note: This option only applies to `ipv4_algorithms`.
##   - "web_service" connects to a URL of a public site that is expected to
##     return our public IP address. If we get an address back that is globally
##     routable, and is returned and searching stops.
