## Configure how the public IP address should be determined. This is a list of
## algorithms to use, and the order in which to use them. Each one is tried in
## sequence until one succeeds, or all have failed. If all algorithms fail, or
## if the algorithm list for a given IP version is empty, then the tool
## behaves as though the system does not have a public IP address using that
## IP version.
##
## The available algorithms are as follows:
##
##   - "default_public_ip" means that IP addresses on the system are checked
##     for any that are globally routable. If any are found, they are used and
##     searching stops.
##
##   - "internet_gateway_protocol" performs a local network search for a router
##     or other Internet gateway device with a WAN IP address that is globally
##     routable. If any are found, they are used and searching stops.
##     NOTE: This option only applies to `ipv4_algorithms`, and is not
##     available for IPv6.
##
##   - "web_service" connects to a URL of a public site that is expected to
##     return our public IP address. If we get an address back that is globally
##     routable, it is returned and searching stops. The encoding for the web
##     service's response will use the first of the following methods to be
##     present:
##      1. If the response includes a "Content-Type" header with a "charset"
##         specified, that will be used.
##      2. If the web-service algorithm includes a "default_encoding" option,
##         that will be used.
##      3. If neither of the above is given, "ISO-8859-1" will be used.
##
##   - "plugin" runs a local command that is expected to return our public IP
##     addresss. If we get an address back that is globally routable, it is
##     returned and searching stops. The command to run can be specified either
##     as a single string (which will be executed via the system shell) -- or
##     as a list of strings (which will be treated as the command path followed
##     by individual arguments). The plugin output will be decoded using
##     whichever of the following is the first to succeed:
##      1. If the optional "encoding" option is specified, that will be used.
##      2. (Windows only) If either of the first two bytes of output are a NULL
##         byte (i.e., 0x00), the output will be decoded as UTF-16 using the
##         system's native byte-order. Alternatively, if the first few bytes
##         contain a byte-order mark (BOM) for UTF-8, UTF-16-LE, or UTF-16-BE,
##         the output will be decoded using the indicated encoding.
##      3. The system's default encoding will be consulted next. On Windows,
##         this is the active console codepage (i.e., the output from "chcp"),
##         while on POSIX systems it will be the first of the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE,
##         or LANG environment variables to specify a codeset component.
##      4. If no encoding is still apparent after all of the above or the
##         system default is unsupported, a warning will be logged and UTF-8
##         used.
